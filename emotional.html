    <p>and I'm actually really really sorry..  
    firstly cuz ur bestfriend is dumb and makes u wait at the bus stop and also is soo boring that she makes u miss out most of the fun ...  
    also there has been times where this bitch was not by ur side and I'm really sorry..</p>

    <p>but I'm really sorry and wanna tell that ur very important in my life ..  
    i didn't want tell this but everytime u say "usharu" a younger part of me that was dead comes back ....  
    it gives me a reassurance that how much ever i fuck up .. eod my bestfriend is there for me to tell "everything's fine"</p>

    <p>In short.. thank you for existing in my life and being the best thing about it  
    and I'm sorry for you cuz I'm dumb and boring .</p>
